# Overview

In this lab, you will learn about adding multiple sprites to your MakeCode Arcade projects. You also will learn about sprite kinds. You will create a project that will evolve in future labs.

## Part 1: Your hero sprite

Let’s create a project for this lab and add your hero sprite to it.

1. Use the template project provided.
2. Add your first sprite to the project. This will be your hero sprite, so give it an appropriate name.
3. Draw an image for your hero sprite. (Keep your image simple for now. You can always come back and improve it later.)
4. Place your hero sprite in one of the corners of the screen using the Set Sprite Position block.


## Part 2: Your enemy sprite

Now, let’s add a second sprite to your project.

1. As usual, drag a block that creates a new sprite into your project’s on start container block. This will be an enemy sprite, so give it an appropriate name.
2. Draw an image for your enemy sprite.
3. Set the Sprite Kind to “Enemy.”
4. Place your enemy sprite in the corner opposite your hero sprite.

## Part 3: Two more corners

You now know how to add multiple sprites to your MakeCode Arcade projects. You also know how to set a sprite’s kind (or type). Let’s add the remaining characters to our project.

1. Add two more sprites to your project. One sprite will be food, and the other sprite will be a projectile.
2. Give your two new sprites appropriate names.
3. Draw images for your Food and Projectile sprites.
4. Set the Sprite Kinds to “Food” and “Projectile.”
5. Place the new sprites in the other two corners, so that all four corners of the screen are occupied.


## Part 4: The story

Now, we need a story!

6. Your project contains four characters. Construct a story that involves these four sprite types.
7. Include a synopsis of the story at the beginning of the game. Use either a sprite say block or a show long text block. You can find the show long text block in the Game drawer.
8. Give your project a new name that reflects the story that you created. You can change the name of your project at the bottom of the screen, beneath the canvas.
9. If you have extra time, then feel free to go back to your sprite images and improve them. You also can elaborate on your story.
